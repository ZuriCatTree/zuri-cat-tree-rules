# What is this?

If you are seeing this, you are trying to enter one of the chats that are part of the *FurrK Network*!

First of all, a warm **welcome** to you.

To join, we need you to understand that we are a series of chats that do not accept minors in our spaces **at all**, be it SFW or NSFW. This is an **active** decision made by all of us, given the nature of adult spaces.

> No minors will be allowed in our spaces. This is final and probably not going to change.

## How do I proceed?

> Thank you for asking!

First, we require you to go check out the [Rules](../rules/README.md). We have instructed admins to NOT REPLY to you if you do not acknowledge them while trying to join first thing.

We require some kind of documentation to enter. We do **not** save your documentation in any way, nor would we ever want to. The only way documentation remains visible to us, is if you decide not to delete it in a chat.

### How to be Allowed In

Please follow the following steps:

1. Request to join a chat through the join button
2. Talk to any of our admins. You can check who are the current admins using [this link](../staff/admins.md).
3. Make sure you tell them you are seeking to join a specific chat
4. Send your ID (See [accepted forms of ID here](./accepted-id.md))
5. Wait for instructions from the admin. You may be accepted into the group or be asked for some further proof of documentation.
6. You will **NOT** be required to send your ID anymore when trying to join other groups in the network.
