## What are Roles?

Roles are a necessary and easy way to manage responsibilities when it comes to the network. The network itself divides all responsibilities into two different different scopes: roles and teams. To learn more about teams, head down to [teams](#what-are-teams).

| Role | Description |
| :- | -: |
| Owner | The **owner** is the single highest point of contact and responsibility of a single point of a network. The owner must try to appeal to all the admins and mods alike, while keeping the experience of the network as enjoyable as possible. Under special circumstances, it is the responsibility of the owner to take control of the situation if necessary. Under emergencies, the owner is the one that has to coordinate all other admins and make decisions. Under any other circumstances, the owner is no different than a polymorph. |
| Admin | An admin is an admin because they are the main point of contact for the owner. They are one tier under in a hierarchy, logically, but not functionally. Admins have complete freedom over their actions as they deem necessary, but may be subjected to reactions from other admins, mods, polymorphs and the owner themselves. They are oftentimes team leaders. |
| Mod | Most of the staff can be considered mods. Mods hold the same powers as admins, but are often scoped to a specific platform, team and group. They are supposed to hold the most responsibility in a scope because they hold the most **context.** Unlike other hierarchies, **mods are not under admins, but rather are a sibling tier that can act within a more specific context.** While admins coordinate actions in a scope (or between them), mods are highly specialized in their own scope. |
| Polymorphs | Polymorphs are meant to be the most versatile out of all the roles, but are the least specialized as a consequence. They are meant to help where able, and oftentimes have weird responsibilities or are owners of their own chats and networks. They are not a default role like Mods and Admins, but a rather evolution of how help has been needed throughout. |

## What are Teams?

Teams are a way to define a scope for different members of the staff. Teams are directed or coordinated by admins and the owner (when needed). Mods specialize in their team and admins act as coordinators between their team and others.

| Team | Responsibilities | Justification |
| :-: | :- | -: |
| **Network Logistics** | Internal Roles, Processes, Approvals, Effectiveness | As the network grows, internal management is more than necessary. This team solves the problem that appears when teams become numerous: a way to control the internal processes, recognize problems and solve them, etc. |
| **Moderation** | Chat Moderation | The moderation team is probably the best understood amongst all the teams. This team solves the main problem when it comes to chats: bring order and well-being to the chat in ways that are fair and justified. They act based on the rules that a chat presents and maintain a healthy environment for everybody to exist in. |
| **Member Satisfaction** | Long-Term Events, Chat Feeling | Participating in chats is not only about talking, but rather in participating in different activities. The Member Satisfaction Team seeks to create long-term events that make the chat unique, compared to others. They may organize group art pieces, games or large-scale events to keep the community alive. |
| **Member Engagement** | Short-Term Events, Spontaneous | The Member Engagement team is similar to the *Member Satisfaction* team in the sense that it controls events, but it differs in the nature of such events. Mostly, this team manages short-lived events that may be recurring or simply spontaneous. If you want to suggest an event, you can contact a member of this team for the creation. Events that would fit in here would be movie nights, game events, etc. |
